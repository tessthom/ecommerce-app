# eCommerce App

A full-featured eCommerce app built with Node JS and Express. This project uses a file-based data store just for a little fun hands-on experience. This is of course not robust enough for production use - would have to write to the fs on every update, couldn't actually run on different machines, can't open/write to the same file simultaneously, etc.

- Product creation form with image upload
- User auth
- Shopping cart
- Public main products page
- Product details page

This project relies on the following:

- **Express**
- **Nodemon**
